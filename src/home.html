					<h3>The Conference</h3>
					<p>From the very beginning we were focused on people, not on companies. Being developers ourselves we thrive to provide the ultimate experience that you'll remember. We'd like to connect awesome speakers with the willing to-learn-and-share-knowledge community. It's not only about sessions - it's about meeting with like-minded people - this can result in great ideas, is that right?</p>

							<p class="bio">Russ started his career doing that other kind of engineering, the sort that involves motors, gears and getting dirty. Pretty rapidly the wonder of computer programming lured Russ away, which probably explains why most of his fingers are still intact. Since turning to coding, Russ has worked on everything from 3D design and image processing software to database query engines and workflow systems. Russ is the author of two highly regarded books: The first, Design Patterns in Ruby was published in 2008 and is a complete reworking of the classic Gang of Four patterns for a modern dynamic programming language. Russ's second book Eloquent Ruby is a guide to writing idiomatic Ruby.</p>

											<p>People don’t talk about getting fired. We come up with euphemisms: “I’m funemployed!”, or “I’m looking for my next journey!” That’s strange, when you think about it, given that it’s a fairly normal event that happens from time to time. But mostly it’s tragic, because unless we start talking about firing and getting fired, we can’t begin to start improving this very real—and often very painful—process.</p>

										<p class="title">React: Learn Once Write Anywhere</p>
										<span class="speaker top">Brian Holt</span>
										<div class="info">
											<p>React has set the front end development world on fire. It seems nearly over night that React became the darling of JavaScripts developers everywhere and before you knew it, sites like Netflix, reddit, Khan Academy, Airbnb, and more were rewriting entire front ends to harness that power.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                The React inferno isn't contained to just the DOM though; other communities have taken notice and are beginning to harness the power of the one-way data flow that React enforces. In this talk we'll give you a brief overview of why React is so (r)evolutionary for user interface development and some other communities that have taken hold of it as well. We'll talk about seeing React everywhere from the DOM to the terminal, native mobile, game consoles, three dimensional environments, and even virtual reality.

										<p class="title">You might not need a CSS preprocessor</p>
										<span class="speaker top">Serg Hospodarets</span>
										<div class="info">
											<p>
                                                All developers got used to use (post/pre)processors for CSS- Sass, Stylus, postCSS whatever. There are powerful variables, mixins and other benefits. But all they are defined and can be changed only during the build phase, which prevents developers from having any flexibility in the browser.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Imagine for a second that the browsers includes all these out of the box- you can change variables and apply mixins on the fly and the browser renders everything correctly. Sounds incredible? But it’s already implemented and works!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In the talk the community will be acquainted with the CSS custom properties (native variables). In short it’s native variables in CSS which provide all the flexibility you dreamed about. Having live native variables which inherit, cascade and have scopes gives abilities e.g. to apply color theming on the fly and easily pass any CSS data to JavaScript + many others.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Continuing the idea of movement from preprocessors directly to browsers CSS @apply rule will be highlighted. It gives a native CSS mixins for the Web. Using it clearfix and others can be easily applied on the fly.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                And of course a couple of serious demos like generating colors directly in CSS from custom properties and their usage for animations and transitions will take place.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                You’ll learn how to avoid copy paste clones in the code and use the power of live variables and mixins.

										<div class="info">
											<p>For too long we've lived under the tyranny of n-tier architectures. Building systems with complicated abstractions, needless indirection and more mocks in our tests than a comedy special. But there is a better way - thinking in terms of architectures of vertical slices instead horizontal layers. Once we embrace slices over layers, we open ourselves to a new, simpler architecture, changing how we build, organize and deploy systems.</p>

										<div class="info">
											<p>“It’s obvious that SPA interfaces rely on RESTful APIs”. But does it have to be like this always? Tight-coupling between interfaces and APIs result in great development issues. Backend-less development is an emerging approach of decoupling the two sides, enabling them to be developed independently.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                The costs and the benefits of mocking the entire API. The three possible architectural approaches in doing so. Simulating business logic in mocks using plain JavaScript and JSONs. Mock engine Examples in Angular.js and sinon.js. The technical and business aspects of separating frontend and backend - these are the topics I will cover, basing on my banking software development experience.

											<p>You've spent months re-architecting your monolith into the new microservices vision. Everyone gathers around to flip the switch. You navigate to the first page...and nothing happens. Refresh...still nothing. The site is so slow, it won't respond for minutes. What happened? </p>

I'll show the modeling, development and production problems we found, and how we slowly morphed the new distributed monolith into our final picture of sanity. While we can't prevent project failures, we can at least identify problems early on in our design so that our final product results in a clean, robust distributed system.

Interestingly, you can also download the entire data dump of StackOverflow and let machine learning loose on the dataset. In the talk I’ll look at what we can learn from the crowdsourced knowledge of developers worldwide. Meanwhile, you will also learn about ideas behind some machine learning algorithms that can give us insights into complex data. I will use a combination of statistical computing language R with functional language F# to show how you can easily access and process large-scale data the functional way.

										<span class="speaker top">Kurt Leucht</span>
										<div class="info">
											<p>As humans push further beyond the grasp of earth, robotic missions in advance of human missions will play an increasingly important role.  These robotic systems will find and retrieve valuable resources as part of an in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) strategy.  They will need to be highly autonomous while maintaining high task performance levels.  NASA Kennedy Space Center has teamed up with the Biological Computation Lab at the University of New Mexico to create a swarm of small, low-cost, autonomous robots to be used as a ground-based research platform for ISRU missions.  The behavior of the robot swarm mimics the central-place foraging strategy of ants to find and collect resources in a previously unmapped environment and return those resources to a central site.  This talk will guide the audience through the Swarmie robot project from its conception by students in a New Mexico research lab to its robot trials in an outdoor parking lot at NASA.  The software technologies and techniques used on the project will be discussed, as well as various challenges and solutions that were encountered by the development team along the way.</p>

										<div class="info">
											<p>As a marketer, I spend a lot of time talking about brands. Brand voice. Brand vision. Brand imaging. You can’t throw an iPhone two feet at a blogger conference without hearing about someone’s brand. But what nobody talks about when it comes to brand building is what happens at the moment of connection. That moment when someone chooses to share or subscribe or plus one or give your content a thumbs up. What’s happening in that moment is empathy marketing at it’s most pure. It’s the start of a true relationship between the content creator and their audience, and it’s the most valuable relationship a company - a brand - can build. Let’s explore this openhearted marketing together though storytelling, personal experiences and - at the core of it all - vulnerability.</p>

Instead of relying on biased human guess ,we use historical data to run statistical simulation forecasts. Not only is the outcome significantly better but it also requires less work.

										<span class="speaker top">Kurt Leucht</span>
										<div class="info">
											<p>Every year in history classrooms all across the United States, young students are taught about the great westward expansion by the early American pioneers.  These visionary pioneers were drawn to the ideas of exploration and adventure along with the promise of a land of opportunity that was open to them.  They faced danger and even death in their efforts to conquer this new frontier.  These pioneers and explorers could not pack up their entire household and carry enough food, clothing, and other supplies to last their entire journey.  They had to be prepared to live off the land and use the local resources in order to survive and thrive.  So too, will future explorers have to live off the land as they venture out into new frontiers of space exploration and colonization.  This talk will introduce the audience to several in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) technologies that are being investigated for NASA’s Journey to Mars.  These technologies are needed for missions where astronauts will live, work, and be productive on another planet.  After all, pioneers and explorers are not just people we read about in history class.  Because we are the explorers of today!</p>

										<p class="title">I would rather have a backend guy write frontend code than the other way round</p>
										<span class="speaker top">Mateusz Tarnaski</span>
										<div class="info">
											<p>Nowadays frontend does not only have to look well. It has to perform, it has to be developed fast, not rarely by multiple teams, it has to be easy to update, change, you name it. The way we have been doing frontend does not really make all that achievable without sacrificing sanity of developers put to the task.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                The funny thing is: developers have been dealing with problems like these for quite some time. Even more: the greatest brains of software development have come up with some pretty neat techniques to use when those situations arise. Most of them have catchy acronyms, too!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Unfortunately we (on the frontend side) didn’t use all that experience from the start. We were the cool kids trying to deal with problems our own way. I have seen it time and time again: custom code for well defined problems, jquery spaghetti hell, 4k+ scripts.js files containing all application frontend logic with hardcoded markup…
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Well, it doesn’t work. We are waking up to that fact and we are doing what we can to learn all the tricks from the ‘old dogs’ and use them with our cool shiny tools. We will take a look at how it’s done, what is here already and what the future might have in store for us.

										<span class="speaker top">Sebastian Bełczyk</span>
										<div class="info">
											<p>Actor model is a computational model specifically suited for building distributed, high-performance, fault tolerant systems. However, the popular actor model platforms still leave many distributed system problems to the developers.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Virtual Actors is an abstraction over actor model which helps developers deal with reliability and distributed resource management at the same time retaining the best traits of actor model.

                                                Orleans was the first framework which implements runtime for virtual actors. In this talk I’ll explain what are virtual actors and show you how to use them to build reliable, distributed applications.

										<span class="speaker top">Adam Jaworski</span>
										<div class="info">
											<p> This will be about user experience. Not an usual boasting of how designers solve the world and users’ problems, but rather, how engineers do it. And how they can do it. And why they need to do it. And how they did it during the history, when best user experience was happening as a byproduct of a just great product design.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Motocykl OSA, slicing bread machine, or Pad-Thai dish are among many others non-designers products, that has been producing great user experiences for their users. Yet, no designer was involved, however those items were perfectly designed by engineers to solve particular problems. And were beautiful.
                                            </p>

                                                I’d like to convince software engineers, that they don’t need to wait for a designer to start influencing good user experience. UX is not only about visual design, but also about credibility, findability, accessibility, etc.
                                            </p>

											<p>DevOps techniques and tools have made great strides across the software world. There’s more gains to be had though, and that’s most obvious in the open-source world. Open-source has never been the most accessible part of software development to jump into, but with DevOps we can fix that.</p>

                                                In this talk we’ll look at how DevOps can be used to improve development in open-source. We’ll see real-world examples of how tools like Vagrant, Ansible and Docker have been used to simplify setup, development and deployment processes on a selection of open-source projects, and learn how you too can help make open-source more open, for everybody.

										<div class="info">
											<p>Continuous delivery is a huge step forward in our ability to rapidly deliver features and value to the users of distributed applications, but it comes with a cost and a responsibility. Most modern web applications need to be highly available, and this also means that it should be up during the deployments. Dealing with zero-downtime deployments is a challenge, and there is no easy solution. Moreover, the solutions available vary based on the number of integrated clients, which parts of the World it addresses, how many active users it has… Isn’t there a simple way to figure out how to get there?</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Join me to get into the details of the key steps on your path to zero downtime deployments. Learn about the patterns, practices and techniques that make it easier, such as semantic versioning and blue/green deployments. We’ll also walk through an end-to-end demo of how a high traffic web application can survive the challenge of deployments.
                                            </p>

											<p>From the mathematicians and scientists of the 20th centuries to today’s ninja craftsmen/craftswomen, Software community hast lost something along the way. Instead of carefully observing scientific methods and maintaining objectivity, we have tangled ourselves in web of hype, and celebrity culture - as if adopting today’s YOLO motto. We have completely forgot how to reason scientifically about matters of technical dispute, instead, whoever is more opinionated or shouts louder wins - as if software is an abstract art where you can only form an opinion.</p>

With a survey of the history of software, we will try to find our roots highlighting the wrong footsteps we have taken as an industry. It also shines a ray of light with the recent rise in adoption of scientific methods as a result of pick up in Machine Learning and Data Science. A sobering talk yet not without sprinkles of fun and sense of humour…

                                                What do data science, digital signal processing, machine learning, databases, mobile platforms, devops, containers, sensors, and micro-controllers have in common?
                                            </p>

                                                You’ve heard it a million times, it is so easy to collect your own data with things such as Arduino sensor shields, wristbands, and even mobile phones. You can monitor your sleep, the time you spend in the pub, count how many steps you took last Sunday, and how many times you listened to Taylor Swift last week, even though your twitter bio reads that your favourite band is Radiohead.
                                            </P>
                                            <p>
                                                But when you use commercial products, what happens to your data? where does it all go? and more importantly, how is it used? There is no final answer to those questions but some of that data can be used to derive a lot of your personal information, as Liccardi et al. demonstrate in I know where you live: Inferring details of people’s lives by visualizing publicly shared location data, ACM SIGCHI 2016.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This talk is about how to construct your own data pipeline, from collection, to signal processing, to storage, and to aggregated analysis and visualisation. Through a series of examples, a number of basic data science principles will be explained, showing what can be achieved with data, and certain concerns that it brings in terms of privacy. A number of free and open source tools will be used throughout the examples, with a focus on tools that adhere to End User Development (EUD) principles, from data gathering with a drag and drop, blocks based, mobile app development tool, to routing data through a flow based system, and to displaying charts and graphs in an interactive notebook.

											<p>It is time to get out of your web browser boundaries! With a new technology "Web Bluetooth", our web apps are finally able to communicate directly with Physical Devices and control them. Whether it is a heart-rate sensor, a BB-8 robot, or your smart refrigerator - Web Bluetooth got you covered. In this talk, we will learning the basics of the underlying Bluetooth Low Energy technology, then cover the Web Bluetooth APIs, and finally engage in a live demo where we will control a Smart Light Bulb, as well as a cute 3D-printed Robot, directly from a web page.</p>

											<p>In the Enterprise scale organisation making lean changes is not easy. There is a lot of legacy systems around, many requirements and processes in order to deliver any change. Many people have saying in the final outcome of any initiative. But what if sometimes it’s better break those rules and communication patterns and just trust your individuals. What if you see business opportunity that everybody else seems to miss? This talk tells true story, how 2 devs used their 20% innovation time to deliver a new user experience. How technology enabled testing this experience in (almost) safe manner. Our test resulted in direct revenue increase, but what really matters is the learnings we took. Let me share some of those learnings.</p>

						<h4>React + Redux</h4>
						<p class="info">
                            Surely by now you have heard the buzz surrounding Facebook’s React. More and more people and companies are using it to build largescale production apps (including at Netflix). Brian Holt guides attendees through an overview of React. In this training, attendees will go from knowing nothing (or very little) about React to building a whole app using React and Redux. React has some neat bells and whistles, like virtual DOM and the speed at which it can render content to the DOM and update it thereafter. However, these are not the most compelling reasons to use React. React introduced some fundamental concepts to the frontend development world, chief among them declarative components and oneway data flow. Brian outlines how you can take these concepts and apply them to any code you’re writing. In addition to covering how to write user interfaces using React, Brian will explore managing data using Redux. Redux is a great library from Dan Abramov that makes managing data stores very simple. We will discuss how to use Redux to make Fluxlike stores.
                            <br/><br/>
                            As a bonus, Brian will give a brief treatise on universal rendering with Node.js using React and a discussion of what is new in the React community.

						<h4>Internet of Things - Build It</h4>
						<p class="info">
                            Hands-on workshop for building connected IoT electronic devices. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or “things” embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data (Wikipedia). As of today, there are more than 20 billion connected devices, including smart cars, wearable devices, connected agriculture and medical devices, and more.
                            <br/><br/>
                            In this workshop, we will learn how to build our own IoT connected devices. We will start with some electronics fundamentals, learn about the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi platforms and the different connectivity options, and even get some handson experience with building our own devices. Each participant will create several of Arduino projects, starting from a simple “Hello World” program, and advancing to build a fully functional twitter connected “Simon Says” game with physical buttons and LEDs.
No prior electronics or hardware project is assumed, and hardware kits will be provided.

						<h4>Building Scalable JavaScript Apps</h4>
						<p class="info">Building and maintaining large and scalable JavaScript web apps isn’t easy. So how do you build such things without being driven to madness? Using and combining proven JavaScript patterns will do the trick. In this oneday workshop, we’ll discuss the patterns behind some of the largest JavaScript apps, such as Gmail and Twitter, and we’ll explore how to apply them in your own apps. We’ll start from object patterns and then focus on module patterns, promises, timers, and more.</p>
